# Terrain Generation
Generates a terrain mesh based on 4 adjustable parameters.

The generation is based on [Perlin Noise](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Mathf.PerlinNoise.html) in combination with x & z coordinates. The generation can be seeded as well, which makes this a great start for a chunk-based game.
